Router and htaccess need work to be done after fixing some prototype;
addproduct page must dynamically add new fields after the last one was filled - done

add2.js is sort of backup, get rid of it at the end of project - done

- IMPORTANT - you haven't done anything related to validating input;
- add default field to type switcher
- IMPORTANT - refactor Product model (add setters and getters, make construct with no parameters);
- IMPORTANT - have three db tables (books, dvds, furnitures) instead of one products
